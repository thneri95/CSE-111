CSE-111: Programming with Functions
This repository contains programming assignments and projects for the CSE-111 course from my BSc in Sotware Development at Byu-Idaho,
thir course focusing on the principles of programming with functions with Python. 
The course aims to enhance programming skills by emphasizing modularity, reusability, and efficient problem-solving through the effective use and creation of functions.

ðŸ“š Course Overview
CSE-111 typically covers fundamental programming concepts with a strong emphasis on functional decomposition. Topics often include:

Introduction to Python Programming: Basic syntax, data types, variables, and operators.

Defining and Calling Functions: Understanding function headers, parameters, return values, and function calls.

Scope of Variables: Local and global variable scope within functions.

Modular Programming: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable functions.

Error Handling: Implementing try-except blocks for robust function design.

Testing Functions: Strategies for unit testing and debugging functions.

Data Structure: Lists, dictionaries, and their manipulation with functions.

File I/O: Reading from and writing to files using functions.
