# CSE‑111: Programming with Functions 🐍

**Author**: Tiago Neri  
**Course**: CSE‑111 – Programming with Functions  
**Degree**: BSc in Software Development, BYU‑Idaho

## 🎯 Course Overview

CSE‑111 focuses on Python and emphasizes functional decomposition: writing clear, reusable functions that solve problems efficiently. My assignments progressed from fundamental scripting to modular, testable Python programs.

✅ Summary
This repository now stands as both:

Portfolio: Clear record of modular Python skills

Roadmap: A structured progression from script writing to functional design and testing



## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`module01/` to `moduleXX/`** – Each folder corresponds to a course module  
- **`sandbox/`** – Area for experimenting with functions or library features  
- **`tests/`** – Unit and integration tests as assignments progressed  
- **`.vscode/`** – VS Code configurations, code formatting settings  
- **`requirements.txt`** – External packages used (e.g., pytest, pylint)

## 🗓️ Module-by-Module Progression

| Module | Theory & Skills | Key Projects |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Module 01** | Python syntax, I/O, simple script functions | Temperature converter, greeting scripts |
| **Module 02** | Defining/scoping variables, returning values | Voting eligibility checker, simple calculators |
| **Module 03** | Modular programming & parameterization | Temperature converters, BMI calculator with functions |
| **Module 04** | Collections + functions | List manipulation, dictionary summarizers |
| **Module 05** | File I/O within functional structure | CSV readers, text analyzers using file-based data |
| **Module 06** | Exception handling, robust functions | Try/except blocks for safe user input |
| **Module 07** | Testing strategies | Unit tests using `pytest`, doctests |
| **Module 08** | Integration project | Combined modules into mini-app (e.g. student grade reporter) |

*(Extend table as you complete more modules.)*

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Learned

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **IDE/Editor**: VS Code (with Python linting, formatting)  
- **Testing**: `pytest`, built-in `doctest` support  
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub – consistent commits highlight iterative learning  
- **CLI**: `pytest` integration, linting via `pylint`, `flake8`, etc.  
- **Package Management**: `pip`, `venv`, `requirements.txt`

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- **Functional decomposition**: Broke complex tasks into simple, focused functions  
- **Reusability & cohesion**: Created modular functions serving single purposes  
- **Error resilience**: Built robust programs with exception handling  
- **Testing proficiency**: Designed and used test suites to ensure function correctness  
- **File handling**: Read/write data in a clean, functional style  
- **Code hygiene**: Adopted linting, code formatting, and unit tests early on
