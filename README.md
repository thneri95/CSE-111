CSE-111: Programming with Functions
This repository contains programming assignments and projects for the CSE-111 course,
focusing on the principles of programming with functions. The course aims to enhance programming skills by emphasizing modularity, reusability, and efficient problem-solving through the effective use and creation of functions.

📚 Course Overview
CSE-111 typically covers fundamental programming concepts with a strong emphasis on functional decomposition. Topics often include:

Introduction to Python Programming: Basic syntax, data types, variables, and operators.

Defining and Calling Functions: Understanding function headers, parameters, return values, and function calls.

Scope of Variables: Local and global variable scope within functions.

Modular Programming: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable functions.

Error Handling: Implementing try-except blocks for robust function design.

Testing Functions: Strategies for unit testing and debugging functions.

Data Structure: Lists, dictionaries, and their manipulation with functions.

File I/O: Reading from and writing to files using functions.

📁 Repository Structure
The repository is organized to reflect the weekly assignments or major projects of the course. You will typically find:

.
├── week01/
│   ├── assignment.py
│   └── README.md
├── week02/
│   ├── project_name.py
│   └── README.md
├── ...
└── final_project/
    ├── main.py
    ├── modules/
    └── README.md

Each weekXX/ directory (or similar naming convention) will contain the code for that week's assignments or labs.

README.md files within each directory provide specific instructions, problem descriptions, and explanations for the code contained therein.

🚀 Getting Started
To run the Python programs in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your system.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Download and install from python.org.

Installation
