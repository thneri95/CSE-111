Program: Discount Calculator for Retail Store

This program calculates the total amount a customer needs to pay, applying a 10% discount on Tuesdays and Wednesdays if
 the subtotal is $50 or more.  The program automatically retrieves the current day from the system and applies a 6% sales 
 tax to the final amount.

Challenges and Bug Fixes:
- Initially, the discount logic was not applying correctly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so I added print statements for 
debugging and verified the day retrieval using `datetime.weekday()`.- Another issue was rounding errors in floating-point
 calculations. To fix this, I used Python's `round()` function for better precision.- I also encountered user input errors,
 so I implemented exception handling to ensure valid numerical input.

Lessons Learned:
- Understanding how to retrieve and use system date/time in Python
- Importance of debugging using print statements and testing edge cases
- Managing floating-point precision and improving user input handling

    discount = 0
    if day_of_week in [1, 2] and subtotal >= 50:  # Tuesday (1) or Wednesday (2)
        discount = subtotal * 0.10
    return discount

    return subtotal * tax_rate

            print(f"Discount amount: {discount:.2f}")
        print(f"Sales tax amount: {sales_tax:.2f}")
        print(f"Total: {total:.2f}")

        print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.")

# Final Thoughts:
#  This project helped me practice handling user input, working with dates, and applying conditional logic efficiently
#  It reinforced the importance of debugging and testing under different scenarios. Additionally, handling floating-point
#  precision issues gave me insights into best practices for financial calculations in Python
