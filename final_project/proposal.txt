W05 - Proposal - Final Project
Author: Tiago Borges 


CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program
---------------------------------------------
What is the title of your program?
Loan Installment Calculator


---------------------------------------------
What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

Many people struggle to understand how loans and interest rates affect their payments over time. This program will 
help users calculate their loan installments based on different interest rates (simple and compound), allowing them 
to make informed financial decisions

------------------------------------


What will you learn from developing this program?

How to implement financial formulas in Python

How to structure a program with multiple functions

How to write and execute test cases using pytest

How to format and present financial data clearly

----------------------------------------------

What Python modules will your program use?

math (for financial calculations)

pytest or unittest (for testing functions)
----------------------------------------------
List the names of functions you will need?

calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time): Calculates the monthly installment using simple interest

calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time): Calculates the monthly installment using compound interest

get_user_input(): Collects loan details from the user

display_results(principal, rate, time, installment, total_paid, total_interest): Displays the calculated
loan details in a readable format

---------------------------------------------------------

List the names of the test functions you will write:

test_calculate_simple_interest()

test_calculate_compound_interest()
