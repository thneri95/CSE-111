Program : Sentence Generator

Description:
This Python program generates six randomly structured sentences using functions to construct phrases with determiners,
nouns, verbs, and prepositional phrases. It follows the assignment's requirements by ensuring variation in number (singular/plural)
and verb tense (past, present, future).

Bonus Features:
1- Each sentence includes a second prepositional phrase to enhance complexity
2- The structure follows the call graph as outlined in the assignment

How It Works:
1. The `main` function calls `make_sentence` to generate six sentences
2. `make_sentence` calls helper functions to obtain determiners, nouns, verbs, and prepositional phrases
3. `get_prepositional_phrase` constructs a phrase by calling `get_preposition`, `get_determiner`, and `get_noun`
4. Sentences are printed with proper capitalization and randomness for variety

# This project successfully meets the given requirements and includes an extra prepositional phrase to exceed expectations
# It demonstrates modular function usage and structured randomness in sentence generation

# Thank you for reviewing my project. I appreciate your time and feedback!
